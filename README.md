# DATA AND TIME 

## In JavaScript, date and time are represented by the Date object. The Date object provides the date and time information and also provides various methods. A JavaScript date defines the EcmaScript epoch that represents milliseconds since 1 January 1970 UTC1. The Date object is a built-in object in JavaScript that stores the date and time. It provides a number of built-in methods for formatting and managing that data. By default, a new Date instance without arguments provided creates an object corresponding to the current date and time2.
